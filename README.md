## Features

### Key Features
1. **Decentralized Tipping**: Enables users to tip others directly on the Stacks blockchain.
2. **Platform Fees**: A percentage fee is deducted from each tip for platform sustainability.
3. **Reward System**: Users earn reward points for tipping amounts exceeding a threshold.
4. **User Statistics**:
   - Total tips sent and received.
   - Accumulated reward points.
5. **Identity Management**: Links user addresses to usernames and verification status.
6. **Transaction History**: Maintains a detailed log of tipping activities.
7. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error codes to handle edge cases and ensure contract integrity.

## Smart Contract Components

### Constants
- `CONTRACT_OWNER`: The owner's principal address.
- `PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENTAGE`: Fee percentage (default: 5%).
- `MAX_TIP_AMOUNT`: Maximum allowable tip amount (default: 1,000 STX).
- `REWARD_THRESHOLD`: Minimum tip amount to qualify for rewards (default: 1 STX).
- `REWARD_RATE`: Points earned per qualifying tip (default: 10 points).

### Data Structures
- **`user-tip-stats`**: Tracks individual user statistics.
  ```clojure
  { total-tips-sent: uint, total-tips-received: uint, reward-points: uint }
  ```
- **`tip-history`**: Logs transactions.
  ```clojure
  { sender: principal, recipient: principal, timestamp: uint, amount: uint, fee: uint, token-type: string }
  ```
- **`user-identity`**: Stores user profiles.
  ```clojure
  { username: string, verified: bool }
  ```

### Key Functions
#### Public Functions
1. **`tip`**:
   - Transfers a tip to a recipient, deducting a platform fee.
   - Updates user stats and logs the transaction.
   - Example:
     ```clojure
     (tip 'SP123456789' u1000 "STX")
     ```

2. **`set-user-identity`**:
   - Registers or updates a user's username.
   - Example:
     ```clojure
     (set-user-identity "Alice")
     ```

3. **`update-user-reward-points`**:
   - Updates reward points for a user manually.
   - Example:
     ```clojure
     (update-user-reward-points 'SP123456789' u20)
     ```

4. **Read-Only Functions**:
   - `get-user-tip-stats`: Retrieve a user's tipping statistics.
   - `get-user-identity`: Fetch a user's identity information.
   - `get-transaction-logs`: Access logs of a specific transaction.

#### Private Functions
- **`process-tip-transfer`**:
  Handles the actual fund transfer and fee deduction.
- **`calculate-platform-fee`**:
  Computes the platform fee from the tip amount.
- **`update-sender-stats` & `update-recipient-stats`**:
  Updates user statistics after a successful tip.
- **`update-reward-points`**:
  Grants reward points to eligible users.

## Installation & Deployment

1. **Environment Setup**:
   Ensure you have:
   - Clarity development tools installed.
   - A connected Stacks wallet.

2. **Deploy**:
   Deploy the contract using the Stacks CLI or your preferred IDE:
   ```bash
   stacks deploy ./tip-stacks-enhanced.clar
   ```

3. **Configuration**:
   - Update the constants to match your platform's settings.
   - Ensure the `CONTRACT_OWNER` address is correct.

---

## Usage Guidelines

- **For Users**:
  - Use the `tip` function to send tips.
  - Query `get-user-tip-stats` for your statistics.
  - Link your identity using `set-user-identity`.

- **For Platform Owners**:
  - Monitor platform fees and reward points.
  - Handle user verification through `user-identity`.

## Error Handling

### Common Errors
- **`ERR_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` (u1)**: Tip amount exceeds sender's balance.
- **`ERR_INVALID_AMOUNT` (u2)**: Tip amount is invalid (e.g., zero or exceeds maximum).
- **`ERR_TRANSFER_FAILED` (u3)**: Fund transfer failed due to network or balance issues.
- **`ERR_REWARD_UPDATE_FAILED` (u4)**: Reward points update failed.
